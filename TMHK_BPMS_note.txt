【BPMS and KPI monitoring】

3 objectivies can be reached through BPMS:

　1. visualize the process 
    >users can handle progress though visualized business process
     e.g. graph,process model

　2. visualzie the KPI monitoring 
　　> can monitor KPI performance in real-time though visualized images 
　　> data are automatically visualized 
 
　3．enable constant problem handeling 
　　> alert will be sent automatically to the administrator

・Start event
　all users who own im_bpm_user role are able to start the WF

・Parallel Gateway
　if the task holds force_termination_signal, the case will automatically move to terminal end event
 (the casse will close compulsorly)

・Reopen Exclusive Gateway 
　will determine whether the case is a re-open case or not through poc_reopen_flg flag 
　>if poc_reopen_flg exists, move to the Handler Reopen Decision task
　>if poc_reopen_flg does not exist, move to check documents exclusive gateway

・Handler Reopen Decesion 
　a user task responsible for IT Department users
　>use application screen edited by formaDesigner 
　
・Re-assessmentor Payment Adjustment Exclusive Gateway
　an exclusive gateway which defines whetherit is a re-assessment case or a payment adjustment case
　>if poc_reassessment_flg exists, move to the check_documents exclusive gateway
　>if poc_reassessment_flg does not exist, move on to the Decision Making user task 

・Decision Making task
　a user task assigned by users who own poc_handler_cd 
　>this user task is following the due date being established by kpi_decision_make_duedate
　>the handler will enter the decision_result_status 

・Decision Making Result
　the case will branch by the validate being entered during the previous user task (Decision Making task)
　>when the decision_result_status is "offer", move to Declaration user task
　>when the decision_result_status is "decline", move to Operate as Declined CLaim user task

・Declaration user task
　a user task assigned by users who own poc_handler_cd
  due date is following the variable being defined by kpi_offer_duedate
　>use several Logics 
　※中身不明であるため確認すること

・Send an Offer Letter 
　a user task assigned by users who own poc_handler_cd
　due date is following the variable being defined by kpi_offer_duedate
　>use  Logics to send an offer letter to the client
　>set overdue alert
　>get EsResult through LD
　>set PID
　>set execution ID
　※中身不明であるため確認すること
　
・CLient Response intermediate event
　
　>set KPI variable date
　>send poc_offer_response_msg being established in the main process

・Operate as Declined Claim user task
　this user task is being handled by users who own poc_handler_cd
　>this user task is following the due date being established by kpi_decline_duedate
　>poc_client_objection_wait_flg will be established during this user task

・Client Objection Receive(3 months)
　poc_decline_response_msg which is being defined in the process will catch following variables:
　>KPI duedate
　※あまり理解できていないため確認すること
　>if the case does not have poc_decline_accepted_flg, move on to Resume Escalation user task 
　>if the case have poc_decline_accepted_flg,the case will be inactivated and move to CHange the Status as "Inactive"user task

・Change the Status as "Inactive" user task
　a user task which is being handled by users who own poc_handler_cd 
　>the handler manually change the status into "inactivate" through poc_inactivation_confirm screen and move on to the Close/Re-activate Waiting Event

・Resume Escalation user task 
　a user task being handled by users who own poc_handler_cd 
　>manager will be categorized as marine/non-marine manager and assigned 
　>will update the process index
　>error messages being localized (EN/JP/CHN)will be send to the handler? 

・Re-assessment Decision user task 
　a user task being handled by users who own poc_handler_cd 
　>the manager being assigned by previous user task will make re-assessment decision, which is to verify the case as approved or rejected one 
　※LDの中身あまりできていないため確認すること
　>poc_resume_approval_flg will be established in this user task 

・Approve or Reject Exclusive Gateway
　an exclusive gate way that define which branch should the case move on
　>when the case holds poc_resume_approval_flag, get back to Check documents Exclusive Gateway
　>when the case does not hold poc_resume_approval_flag, move to Operate as Declined Claim user task
 

・Declaration user task
　this user task is being handled by users who own poc_handler_cd
　>this user task is following the due date being established by kpi_offer_duedate


・Check documents Exclusive gateway
　call out Logic Design that chek document status  　
　>if the variable of poc_resume_approval_flg and poc_reactivate_flg is null,the progress will terminate
　>if the document is a resume approval case, the process will terminate 
　>if the case's reactive is true/the offer accepted status is false, the logic will provide a reaction inrement number and set up initial state variable
　>once the logic closed, move on to the cancel follow up gateway 
　>check whether documents holds following flags and decide which branch to move on 
   -poc_reactive_flg
   -poc_resme_approval_flg
   -poc_offer_accepted_flg

・Cancel Follow up Exclisive Gateway 
　an exclusive gateway which determine whether the case needa cancel follow up operation 
　>if there is a poc_followup_cancel_flg,there will be no follow up support service and the case will terminate immediately 

・Cycle time exceed Exclusive Gateway
　call out Logic Design which count process instance ID(PID) to determine whether repeat the follow up WorkFLow or not 
 >when PID is empty, variable kpi_followup_is_exit will be delivered as the output of the Logic, therefore move to Change the Status as "Inactive" usertask 
　

・Change the Status as "Inactive" task
　a user task which is being handled by users who own poc_handler_cd 
　>the handler manually change the status into "inactivate" through poc_inactivation_confirm screen and move on to the Close/Re-activate Waiting Event

・Request the Documents task
　a draft task using IM-BIS-Workflow, this task will be repeated untill the cycle time has being exceeded
